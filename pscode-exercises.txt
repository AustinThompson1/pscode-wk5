// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers

Num1=Get int
Num2=Get int
Num1+Num2=sum
Print Sum

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Num1=Get int
if Num1 % 2 then print even
else print odd

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

Num1=Get int
Num2=Get int
Num3=Get int
Num4=Get int
Num5=Get int
Num1+Num2+num3+num4+num5=sum
avg=sum/5
minimum= Num<other num
maximum= Num>other Num
Exercise 3b was rather easy I took the sum of all of the imputted numbers and dividing the amount of numbers
For exercise 3c I could'nt think of a way to type different numbers based on types so I stated num for a number and other num as other numbers.
